Greetings, I'm Saleh Ahmed Shafin, but most people call me Shafin. I come from <b>Dhaka, Bangladesh</b>. I'm a dedicated undergraduate student who has a never-ending curiosity for both science and the arts. I love learning new things, especially when it comes to technology and research. My goal is to use my knowledge to solve engineering problems.

I'm particularly drawn to <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, and I have a strong interest in using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to solve real-world issues. Currently, I'm pursuing a major in <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b> at <b>Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</b>.

I'm actively searching for positions as an <b>ML/DL Engineer</b> or a <b>Trainee AI Engineer</b> in the Software Engineering industry. Additionally, I'm open to opportunities for mentoring and creating educational content. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any exciting opportunities in these areas.
