<p style="text-align: justify;">Greetings! I'm <b>Saleh Ahmed Shafin</b>, but most people call me <b>Shafin</b>. Iâ€™m from <b>Dhaka, Bangladesh</b>, and I currently work as a <b>Python Developer</b> at <b>Codemen Solutions Limited</b>. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <b>Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</b>. My passion lies in learning new technologies and conducting research, with the ultimate goal of using my knowledge to solve engineering problems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In my current role at Codemen Solutions Limited, I have developed and implemented advanced <b>LLM-driven applications</b> and <b>gained significant experience</b> in document search techniques such as <b>Vector RAG</b>, <b>Graph RAG</b>, and <b>Hybrid search</b>. I work with <b>FastAPI</b> and <b>Django</b> to build scalable backend systems and use <b>Docker</b> for seamless application deployment in cloud environments like <b>AWS</b>. Collaborating with <b>global teams</b> has refined my communication and teamwork skills, helping me stay up-to-date with emerging technologies. I'm actively contributing to the community and attending conferences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before my developer role, I worked as a <b>Premium Freelance Marketer</b> at <b>EGEN</b>, where I gained expertise in <b>SEO</b>, <b>content marketing</b>, and <b>data analysis</b>. This experience enhanced my technical acumen and strengthened my adaptability in diverse professional environments.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout my journey, I have participated in several competitions and achieved notable success. I secured <b>4th place</b> in the <b>ML Olympiad</b> - <b>CO2 Emissions Prediction Challenge</b>, <b>10th place</b> in the <b>DU DataVerse Challenge</b> - <b>ITVerse 2023</b>, <b>16th place</b> in the <b>BUET DL Sprint 2.0</b>, and <b>23rd place</b> in the <b>Robi Datathon 3.0</b>. These experiences sharpened my problem-solving abilities and fueled my commitment to AI and ML.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a strong interest in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and am particularly fascinated by the application of <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b> techniques to solve real-world problems. I am continuously exploring new ways to stay at the forefront of these technologies and apply them in meaningful ways.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, I am open to <b>mentoring</b> and <b>creating educational</b> content and would love to connect with anyone interested in collaborating on exciting opportunities in these areas.</p>
